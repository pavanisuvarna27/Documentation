## Django Dynamic Url Creation and  Messages generation
### Dynamic Url Creation:
  - #### What is a URL? ?
    <p>A URL is a web address. You can see a URL every time you visit a website â€“ it is visible in your browser's address bar.(Yes! 127.0.0.1:8000 is a URL! And localhost:8000 is also a URL! And https://github.com/ is also a URL! )</p>

<p>Every page on the Internet needs its own URL. This way your application knows what it should show to a user.</p>
